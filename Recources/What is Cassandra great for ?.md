## What is Cassandra great for ?

As [datastax.com](http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/what-cassandra-good) indicated , Cassandra shines in the situations that need : 

* fast read or write performance

* the ability to add more machines as you need additional capacity

* reliable cross-datacenter replication

To explain these points above :

Cassandra shines at online transactions(real time transactions) that have to be executed in a short time(millisecond) .

The data can be served very quickly to the user using Cassandraâ€™s multiple caching levels , log-structured storage design, and commit log. 

In addition , using MapReduce, Cassandra does very good in the  area of data management .

Now, what is MapReduce?

MapReduce is apopular algorithm by Google that allows for analytical queries to be executed on large data sets among large numbers of servers in parallel.

Finally,Cassandra is great when data loss is unacceptable.

So, the question should be what is Caassandra NOT good for ?
