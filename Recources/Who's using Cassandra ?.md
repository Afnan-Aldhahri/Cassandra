## Who's using Cassandra ?

When I was searching to find which companies are using Cassandra , 

I got suprised by The **huge number** of Cassandra fans (the orgnizations that use Cassandra right now). 

I found a picture from [Introduction to NoSQL & Apache Cassandra  ](http://www.slideshare.net/ChetanBaheti/introduction-to-nosql-apache-cassandra)by chetan.baheti

that show most of these orgnizations but not all of them .

You can visit Cassandra offical website [here] (http://www.planetcassandra.org/companies/) to see all the orgnizations that use Cassandra internally .
