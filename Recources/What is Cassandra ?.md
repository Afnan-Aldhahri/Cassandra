## What is Cassandra ?

As [planetcassandra.org](http://www.planetcassandra.org/what-is-apache-cassandra/) defines Cassandra : "

**Apache Cassandra** is a distributed database for managing large amounts of structured data across

many commodity servers,  while providing highly available service and no single point of failure. 

Cassandra offers capabilities that relational databases and other NoSQL databases simply cannot match such as:

continuous availability, linear scale performance, operational simplicity and easy data distribution

across multiple data centers and cloud availability zones."
