## Why Cassandra ? 

1- **High Performance**

1- **Decentralized**

There is no master node which means the system will be relaible .

If there was a master node , it means if the master fail , the whole system will fail.

However, with Cassandra, no chance for crash beause every node in the cluster has the same job.

3- **Blend of Google BigTable and Amazon Dynamo**

4- **Supports replication and multi data center replication**

Replication strategies are configurable.[15] Cassandra is designed as a distributed system, for deployment of large numbers of nodes across multiple data centers. Key features of Cassandraâ€™s distributed architecture are specifically tailored for multiple-data center deployment, for redundancy, for failover and disaster recovery.

5- **Massively, and linearly scalable**

6- ** Written in Java , so providing native Java support **

7- **Fault-tolerant with no single point of failure **
Multi-data center and rack-aware data replication
Failed nodes can be replaced automatically.

8- **Support for structured and unstructured data**

9- **Tunable consistency**

10- **Online node addition or removal**

11- **MapReduce support**

Cassandra has support for : Apache Pig ,Apache Hive , and MapReduce support. 

12- **Query language**
Cassandra has CQL (Cassandra Query Language), a SQL-like substitutional to RPC interface. 

13- **Cloud enabled**

14- **Location transparent**

15- **Built-in data compression**
